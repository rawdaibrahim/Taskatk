# Taskatk
This is a task management web application developed as part of a web programming course in our college. The application includes a variety of features that allow users to efficiently manage their tasks through a simple and intuitive interface.
Users can create multiple lists, each containing a set of tasks. Completed tasks are automatically moved to a separate "Completed" section, where they can also be deleted. Tasks are organized and viewable in a Monthly Tasks page, categorized as Completed, In Progress, or Overdue. From both the Monthly Tasks page and the Home page, users can view detailed information about each task and update its status or content.
The application also includes a Contact Us page, allowing users to send emails for any issues or feedback.
The user interface was designed following key UI/UX principles:  
- Simplicity and Ease of Use: A clean layout ensures smooth navigation and user interaction.  
- Immediate Feedback: Users receive real-time responses to their actions.  
- Tooltips: Hovering over elements provides helpful tooltips to explain features and actions.  
- Pagination: Implemented for better navigation and performance.  
- User Control and Freedom: Features such as Save and Cancel buttons allow users to freely manage their inputs and decisions.
